# LiDAR-Sensor 
This repository is intended for LCC students using the RPLiDAR sensor within the lab. If using your personal MAC device, download the plugin and unzip the file. Open it up with any software (Mac will suggest you Premiere Pro if you have it installed) for the first time - here your Mac runs a check to recognise the file. Close the software and lauch Touchdesigner. Continue following the instruction provided on CTL's wiki.

This plugin has been built by the Touchdesigner community on Discord upon request, using thepelkus-too's repo - thank you all <3!
